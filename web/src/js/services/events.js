   Events: how services/ tell the page what happened without knowing the page.
   Services emit, ui/ modules subscribe when they load. Handlers run right away, in the order they
   subscribed; one may return a promise, and emit's promise waits for all of them.

     notice   (text, opts)   a message for the user (opts as ui/ui.js notice takes them)
     flush    (path?)        save the editor first, if it has unsaved text (for this note, or any)
     written  (path, opts)   a note was written; opts.silentEditor: the editor already shows this text
     changed  (opts)         notes changed: redraw; opts.disk: they changed on disk, outside the page
     sync                    Git sync's state changed
     sync-setup              a sync was asked for, but there is no remote yet
     update                  a newer version of the app is available
